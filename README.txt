Coffee is a simple and minimalistic browser that is built using python and gives results from Wikipedia articles. To use Coffee, you must have the libraries: GuiZero and Wikipedia.

Since I am a beginner programmer, I couldn't add features that I would like this project to have such as:
1. I do not understand why there is an error every time I search something. I would like to remove this bug.
2. History
3. A better GUI
